"""Producer-task supervisor with bounded backoff + WakeSignal wire enum (E-01/E-02).

This module owns three exports:

  * ``WakeSignal`` (E-02) — closed StrEnum on the cycle scheduler's
    ``event_queue``. Producers ``put_nowait(WakeSignal.UDEV)`` etc.; the
    scheduler treats every wake signal as "do a full re-observation pass."
    Per ADR-0002 the queue carries only opaque sentinels — never state.

  * ``Sleeper`` (Protocol, runtime_checkable) — small async sleep seam so
    tests can advance ``FakeClock`` without real wall-clock waiting
    (PITFALLS §14.1). Production wires a one-line adapter that calls
    ``asyncio.sleep``.

  * ``restart_on_crash`` (E-01) — wraps each producer factory with bounded
    backoff and ``CancelledError`` passthrough. Catches ``Exception`` only
    — never ``BaseException`` — so SIGTERM-driven TaskGroup cancellation
    propagates cleanly. Mirrors the per-task isolation pattern from
    ``observer/orchestrator.py:_probe_one`` at producer-task scope.

Pitfall 15 envelope: ``(1, 2, 4, 8, 60)`` capped — chronic-crash producer
uses ~1.7% CPU at the 60s cap and emits one ``event_source_crashed`` log
per minute. Attempt counter resets after a clean run that lasted longer
than ``reset_after_uptime_s`` (default 300s) so transient crashes don't
accumulate forever.

Anti-patterns explicitly NOT used here (CLAUDE.md):
  * No ``MonitorObserver``, no ``signal.signal``, no ``subprocess`` —
    this module supervises producers; producers themselves talk to udev /
    rtnetlink / asyncinotify / kmsg in their own modules.
