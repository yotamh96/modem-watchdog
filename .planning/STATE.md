# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-05)

**Core value:** Maximize end-user uplink availability across the four bonded modems by applying minimum-impact recovery actions — and never running a destructive recovery that has zero chance of fixing the observed issue.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundations & ADRs

## Current Position

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-05 — Roadmap created from PROJECT.md / REQUIREMENTS.md / research/SUMMARY.md / docs/MIGRATION.md

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Bundle CPython 3.12 via `python-build-standalone` in `.deb` venv (closes Q8) — research SUMMARY §2
- Init: State machine refactored to 5 top-level states + 2 orthogonal flags (`present`, `rf_blocked`); ADR-0008 supersedes ADR-0005's 7-state shape
- Init: State files keyed by `usb_path` (`state/by-usb/<usb_path>.json`); ADR-0009
- Init: HMAC v2.0 webhook signing promoted from v2.1 (closes Q5); ADR-0011
- Init: Per-modem `asyncio.Lock` + globals lock + cross-process `flock`s separate from PID lock; ADR-0012
- Init: Integer-encoded `modem_state_value{modem}` Prom metric (NOT one-hot); ADR-0013

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet — all eight PROJECT.md open questions (Q1-Q8) have a research-recommended answer to be ratified as ADRs in Phase 1.
